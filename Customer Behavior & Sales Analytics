# In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables to uncover valuable insights into customer behavior, sales trends, and invoicing patterns.


#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country!='USA';


#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country='Brazil';


#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT c.FirstName, c.LastName, i.InvoiceId, i.InvoiceDate, i.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers c
  JOIN chinook.invoices i
  ON c.CustomerId=i.CustomerId
WHERE c.Country='Brazil';


#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT *
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Sales%' AND Title LIKE '%Agent%';


#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;


#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

SELECT e.LastName, e.FirstName, i.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.invoices i
  JOIN chinook.customers c 
  ON i.CustomerId=c.CustomerId
  JOIN chinook.employees e 
  ON c.SupportRepId=e.EmployeeId;


#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.

SELECT i.Total, 
c.FirstName AS Cust_FN, 
c.lastName AS Cust_LN, 
c.Country, 
e.FirstName AS Agent_FN, 
e.lastName AS Agent_LN

FROM chinook.invoices i
  JOIN chinook.customers c
  ON i.CustomerId=c.CustomerId
  JOIN chinook.employees e
  ON c.SupportRepId=e.EmployeeId;


#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009-%';


#9. What are the total sales for 2009?

SELECT SUM(Total) AS total_sales_2009
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '2009-%';


#10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t
  JOIN chinook.invoice_items i
  ON t.TrackId=i.TrackId;


#11. Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT 
t.Name AS track_name,
a.Name AS artist_name,
i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
  JOIN chinook.tracks t ON i.TrackID=t.TrackID
  JOIN chinook.albums alb ON t.AlbumId=alb.AlbumId
  JOIN chinook.artists a ON alb.ArtistId=a.ArtistId;


#12.	Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT 
t.Name AS Track_name, 
alb.Title AS Album_name, 
mt.Name AS Media_type, 
g.Name AS Genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
  JOIN chinook.albums alb ON t.AlbumId=alb.AlbumId
  JOIN chinook.media_types mt ON t.MediaTypeId=mt.MediaTypeId
  JOIN chinook.genres g ON t.GenreId=g.GenreId;


#13. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, SUM(i.Total) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.invoices i
  JOIN chinook.customers c ON i.CustomerId=c.CustomerId
  JOIN chinook.employees e ON c.SupportRepId=e.EmployeeId
WHERE e.Title LIKE '%Sales%' AND e.Title LIKE '%agent%'
GROUP BY e.FirstName, e.LastName;


#14. Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, SUM(i.Total) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.invoices i
  JOIN chinook.customers c ON i.CustomerId=c.CustomerId
  JOIN chinook.employees e ON c.SupportRepId=e.EmployeeId
WHERE e.Title LIKE '%Sales%' AND e.Title LIKE '%agent%'
AND i.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009-%'
GROUP BY e.FirstName, e.LastName
ORDER BY SUM(i.Total) DESC
LIMIT 1;
