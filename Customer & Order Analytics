#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product, price
FROM JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM JanSales);

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity*price) AS Total_Revenue
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(Quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS total_revenue
FROM FebSales
WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.acctnum), AVG(Quantity*price)
FROM customers c
  JOIN FebSales f

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(f.Quantity)/COUNT(c.acctnum) AS average_quantity_purchased
FROM customers c

#13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT DISTINCT j.Product, SUM(Quantity*price) AS revenue
